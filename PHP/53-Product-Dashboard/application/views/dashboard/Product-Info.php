                    <h2>Description: </h2>
                    <p>Serina Nekozuka is a serious third-year high school student who's studying hard to qualify for a scholarship. Her cute and stylish looks, however, don't exactly meet the school dress codeâ€”which Reiko Tachibana, a member of the disciplinary committee, is always on her case about. Plus, no matter how much Serina tries, Reiko always bests her in grades and athletics. One day, however, Serina spots Reiko meeting with an unknown woman after school...and going to a love hotel! What will happen between Serina and Reiko now that they share a secret?</p>
